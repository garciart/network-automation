FOR FLASH FORMAT LAB!

When you first configured the router, you gave it a default IOS image (c3745-adventerprisek9-mz.124-25d.bin). However, when the router first starts, it looks for an IOS image in flash memory. This is because the 3745 can store multiple IOS's in flash memory; you tell the router which one you want to use, by inputting ```boot system flash:<the IOS filename>.bin``` at a configuration prompt and saving it in the start-up configuration file. If the router does not find an IOS there, it will look in its Read-Only Memory (ROM) for a default IOS.

Our router will do this because you have not formatted our flash memory, preventing us from uploading another IOS. As a matter of fact, you may see the following error:

```
PCMCIA disk 0 is formatted from a different router or PC. A format in this router is required before an image can be booted from this device
```

In this lab, you will not need another IOS, but you do want to use our flash memory, so let us fix our memory issue, by inputting the following command:

```
format flash:
```

You will be asked to confirm the format operation twice. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> both times:

```
Format operation may take a while. Continue? [confirm]
Format operation will destroy all data in "flash:".  Continue? [confirm]
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```
Format: Drive communication & 1st Sector Write OK...
Writing Monlib sectors.
.........................................................................................................................
Monlib write complete
..
Format: All system sectors written. OK...

Format: Total sectors in formatted partition: 130911
Format: Total bytes in formatted partition: 67026432
Format: Operation completed successfully.

Input ```show flash``` to see what is in the drive:

```
