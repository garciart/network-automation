# Lab 00 - Demo

This demo/tutorial explains how to create a lab in GNS3 and how to use Python automation scripting to configure a router.

>**Note** - If you are unfamiliar with GNS3, visit [https://docs.gns3.com/docs/using-gns3/beginners/the-gns3-gui/](https://docs.gns3.com/docs/using-gns3/beginners/the-gns3-gui/ "The GNS3 GUI") for a great introduction to the GNS3 Graphical User Interface (GUI).

1. Start GNS3 by opening a terminal and running the "gns3_run" bash script, located in /usr/bin.

         [gns3user@localhost ~]$ gns3_run
         Setting up GNS3...
         Original interface name is enp0s3
         enp0s3 original IP address is 10.0.2.15
         enp0s3 original netmask is 255.255.255.0
         enp0s3 original broadcast address is 10.0.2.255
         [sudo] password for gns3user: 

3. When the **Project** window appears, select the **New Project** tab. Enter "Lab00" in the **Name** textbox and click **OK**. If the **Project** window does not appear, select **File -> New blank project** from the top menu or press **[CTRL]+[N]** .
   
![Create a New Project](../images/demo_01.png "Create a New Project")

3. In the **Devices Toolbar** (on the left), click on **New template**, or select **File -> New template** from the top menu:

![Add a New Template - Step 1](../images/demo_02.png "Add a New Template - Step 1")

4. Select **Manually create a new template**:

![Add a New Template - Step 2](../images/demo_03.png "Add a New Template - Step 2")

5. On the left, expand the **Dynamips** node and select **IOS routers**. When the **IOS router templates** window appears, select **New** to add a template:  

![Add a New Template - Step 3](../images/demo_04.png "Add a New Template - Step 3")

6. Choose **New Image** and click **Browse**:

![Add a New Template - Step 4](../images/demo_05.png "Add a New Template - Step 4")

7. During setup, you should have downloaded a Cisco Internetwork Operating System (IOS) for both the Cisco 3745 Multiservice Access Router and the Cisco 7206VXR Router. Select "c7000-a3jk9s-mz.124-25d.bin" to use IOS 12.4(25) Mainline with the Cisco 7206VXR, then click **Open** at the top:

![Add a New Template - Step 5](../images/demo_06.png "Add a New Template - Step 5")

>**Note** - If you do not have these files, you can download the Cisco 3745 IOS manually from [http://tfr.org/cisco-ios/37xx/3745/c3745-adventerprisek9-mz.124-25d.bin](http://tfr.org/cisco-ios/37xx/3745/c3745-adventerprisek9-mz.124-25d.bin) and the Cisco 7206 IOS manually from [http://tfr.org/cisco-ios/7200/c7200-a3jk9s-mz.124-25d.bin](http://tfr.org/cisco-ios/7200/c7200-a3jk9s-mz.124-25d.bin).

8. When asked to decompress the binary file into an IOS image, click **Yes**:

![Add a New Template - Step 6](../images/demo_07.png "Add a New Template - Step 6")

9. When you return to the IOS image selection window, you will see that the binary file has been converted to an image; additional files should appear in the GNS3/images/IOS directory as well. Click **Next**:

![Add a New Template - Step 7](../images/demo_08.png "Add a New Template - Step 7")

10. You can name the device whatever you like (e.g., "Cisco 7206", "My Router", etc.), but for now, accept the default values by clicking **Next**:

![Add a New Template - Step 8](../images/demo_09.png "Add a New Template - Step 8")

11. The minimum RAM for IOS 12.4(25) Mainline is 256 MiB, so accept the default value by clicking **Next**:

![Add a New Template - Step 9](../images/demo_10.png "Add a New Template - Step 9")

12. This device, with one slot for an Input/Output (I/O) controller and six slots for port adapters, may be configured in many different ways, but since we will only be using one port for this demo (FastEthernet0/0), accept the default values by clicking **Next**:

![Add a New Template - Step 10](../images/demo_11.png "Add a New Template - Step 10")

>**Note** - For quick reference, here is a table of the configurations available for this device.

13. In order to prevent the Dynamips emulator from monopolizing resources and locking the system, you will need to set an Idle-PC value. Click on **Idle-PC finder** to find a value:

![Add a New Template - Step 11a](../images/demo_12.png "Add a New Template - Step 11a")

![Add a New Template - Step 11b](../images/demo_13.png "Add a New Template - Step 11b")

>**Note** - Chris Welsh provides an excellent explanation of the Idle-PC value in his blog at [https://rednectar.net/2013/02/24/dynamipsgns3-idle-pc-explained-finally/](https://rednectar.net/2013/02/24/dynamipsgns3-idle-pc-explained-finally/ "Dynamips/GNS3 Idle-PC explained. Finally!").

14. When a value has been found, click **OK** to return to the Idle-PC window. Ensure the **Idle-PC** textbox contains the value, and then click **Finish**:

![Add a New Template - Step 12a](../images/demo_14.png "Add a New Template - Step 12a")

![Add a New Template - Step 12b](../images/demo_15.png "Add a New Template - Step 12b")

15. GNS3 will return you to the template window. Click **OK** to return to the **Workspace**.

![Project window](../images/demo_16.png)

16. In the **Devices Toolbar** (on the left), click on the **Browse all devices** icon and select **Cloud**:
   
![Workspace with new device](../images/demo_17.png "Workspace with new device")

17. Drag a cloud device into the **Workspace**. This is your host machine:

![Add the host](../images/demo_18.png "Add the host")

18. Select and drag a Cisco 7206VXR (i.e., *c7200*) into the **Workspace**:

![Add a device](../images/demo_19.png "Add a device")

19. In the **Devices Toolbar** (on the left), click on the **Add a link** icon. Click on **Cloud1** and connect one end of the link to **tap0**:

![Connect to the host](../images/demo_20.png "Connect to the host")

20. Click on **R1** and connect the other end of the link to **FastEthernet0/0**:

![Connect to the device](../images/demo_21.png "Connect to the device")

>**Note** - To quickly identify nodes in the **Workspace**, click on the **Show/Hide interface labels** icon in the top **Toolbar**, or select **View -> Show/Hide interface labels** from the top menu.

21. Right click on **R1** and **Start** the device (You can also start all the devices using the green **Start/Resume all nodes** icon in the top **Toolbar**):

![Start the device](../images/demo_22.png "Start the device")

22. Right click on **R1** again to open a **Console**:

![Open a console](../images/demo_23.png "Open a console")

23. When the **Console** window appears, press **[Enter]** and wait for the prompt to appear:

![Privileged EXEC Mode](../images/demo_24.png "Privileged EXEC Mode")

>**Note** - If the prompt reads ```R1>```, you are in **User EXEC Mode**. Type and enter ```enable``` at the prompt to enter **Privileged EXEC Mode** (i.e., ```R1>enable```**[Enter]**).

24. Enter the following commands to reset the device; if prompted to ```[confirm]```, press **[Enter]**:
    
         R1#write erase
         Erasing the nvram filesystem will remove all configuration files! Continue? [confirm]
         [OK]
         Erase of nvram: complete
         R1#
         *Feb 24 03:42:43.875: %SYS-7-NV_BLOCK_INIT: Initialized the geometry of nvram
         R1#reload
         Proceed with reload? [confirm]

         *Feb 24 03:42:54.111: %SYS-5-RELOAD: Reload requested by console. Reload Reason: Reload Command.
         ROM: reload requested...

25. Close the **Console** window. Right click on **R1** again and **Stop** the device:
    
>**Note** - Normally, you would enter ```reload``` at the prompt to reload the device. However, do not do this, because GNS3 may crash.

![Exit the console to reload the device](../images/demo_25.png "Exit the console to reload the device")

26. Right click on **R1** again and **Reload**. The device should start automatically:

![Reload the device](../images/demo_26.png "Reload the device")

27. Right click on **R1** again and reopen open a **Console**. This Cisco device stores its configuration settings (**startup-config**) in non-volatile RAM, known as NVRAM. Enter the following command to look at the contents of the NVRAM:

         R1#show startup-config
         Using 410 out of 522232 bytes!
         !
         service timestamps debug datetime msec
         service timestamps log datetime msec
         no service password-encryption
         !
         hostname R1
         !
         ip cef
         no ip domain-lookup
         no ip icmp rate-limit unreachable
         ip tcp synwait 5
         no cdp log mismatch duplex
         !
         line con 0
          exec-timeout 0 0
          logging synchronous
          privilege level 15
          no login
         line aux 0
          exec-timeout 0 0
          logging synchronous
          privilege level 15
          no login
         !
         end

         R1#
         
>**Note** - To save space, we have removed some of the exclamation points in the configuration. This does not affect the settings; the Cisco Tool Command Language (Tcl) uses exclamation points for commenting, and the Cisco command parser inserts exclamation points throughout the configuration to separate sections and improve readability.

28. Compare this to the **running-config**, which is created from the **startup-config** when the device first starts, then stored in the device's volatile RAM:

         R1#show running-config
         Building configuration...

         Current configuration : 744 bytes

          privilege level 15
          logging synchronous
          stopbits 1
         line aux 0

         line vty 0 4
          login
         !
         end
         
         R1#

29. Look for ```interface FastEthernet0/0``` in the running-config (comments added):

         interface FastEthernet0/0
          no ip address
          shutdown
          duplex half

    ```no ip address``` means the router does not have an IP address assigned and ```shutdown``` means that the FastEthernet port is closed. This tells us that the router is not configured and cannot be used.
    
30. We can configure the router within this console, but since we are going to use Python instead, close the console, but make sure the router is still running.

31. Normally, to configure the router, we would connect to it using an auxiliary or console port, and run commands using an emulator, such as Minicom or PuTTY. For this demo, we will connect to the router using Telnet, through our host's Port 5001 (192.168.1.1:5001). Therefore, open a terminal and start a Python session:
    
         [gns3user@localhost ~]$ python
         Python 2.7.5 (default, Nov 16 2020, 22:23:17) 
         [GCC 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-44)] on linux2
         Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
         >>> 

32. Import pexpect and spawn Telnet as a child application (note the space between it IP address and the port number). We also added a delay, just in case the router has not finished starting up:

         >>> import pexpect
         >>> import time
         >>> child = pexpect.spawn("telnet 192.168.1.1 5001")
         >>> time.sleep(30)

>**Note** - If you see ```ImportError: No module named pexpect.```, you will need to install pexpect first. In CentOS/RHEL, open another terminal and run ```yum install pexpect```.

33. Once the delay is over, let's take a look at the system information. First, we want to press **[Enter]** at least once to reach a clean prompt after any messages. Next, we want to make sure we are in **Privileged EXEC Mode** by inputting the "enable" command. By the way, if we already are in **Privileged EXEC Mode**, the "enable" command does not affect anything:

         >>> child.send("\r\n")
         2
         >>> child.send("enable\r\n")
         8
         >>> child.expect_exact("R1#")
         0

>**Note** - Remember, you cannot see feedback from the console yet, so you cannot identify the prompt. In addition, for some reason, ```child.sendline("...")``` did not send a full carriage-return/line-feed (CRLF), so we switched to ```child.send("...\r\n")``` instead.

34. ```child.send("...")``` returns the number of characters that were sent, while ```child.expect_exact("...")``` returns a 0 if it finds a match. If ```child.expect_exact("...")``` does not find a match, it will return an error after its built-in 30-second timeout period expires. We will demonstrate this later.

35. Now that we have looked for a match, we can use ```child.before``` and ```child.after``` to see feedback from the console. Per [pexpect's API overview](https://pexpect.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html "pexpect's API overview"):
 
    *"After each call to expect() the before and after properties will be set to the text printed by child application. The before property will contain all text up to the expected string pattern. The after string will contain the text that was matched by the expected pattern."*

    Therefore, if you enter:

         >>> child.before

    You will see something like:

    To view this in human-readable format, use:
   
         >>> print(child.before.decode("utf-8"))
         Trying 192.168.1.1...
         Connected to 192.168.1.1.
         Escape character is '^]'.
         Connected to Dynamips VM "R1" (ID 1, type c7200) - Console port
         Press ENTER to get the prompt.
         ROMMON emulation microcode.
         ...

    You may also look at what was matched, using ```child.after```:

         >>> child.after
         'R1#'
         >>> print(child.after.decode("utf-8"))
         R1#

36. As promised, before we exit the Python prompt, we will look a ```child.expect_exact error```. Try it out by entering ```child.expect_exact("This won't work.")```; a detailed error message will appear after the built-in 30-second timeout period expires.

37. However, since the purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate Python automation scripting, we will not continue to enter each command individually. Exit the Python session by entering ```exit()``` and open your favorite text editor.

38. We will turn the following commands into a repeatable script:

        R1>enable
        R1#configure terminal ! Enter Global Configuration Mode
        R1(config)#interface FastEthernet0/0 ! Enter Interface Configuration Mode
        R1(config-if)#ip address 192.168.1.20 255.255.255.0 ! Set the IP address of the router
        R1(config-if)#no shutdown ! Bring up the interface
        R1(config-if)#exit ! Exit Interface Configuration Mode
        R1(config)#ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.168.1.1 ! Configure the default gateway
        R1(config)#end ! Exit Global Configuration Mode
        R1#write memory ! Save new configuration to flash memory
        R1#copy running-config startup-config ! Use the current configuration for startup

39. In your editor, enter the following script:

        child = pexpect.spawn('telnet 192.168.1.1 5001')
        time.sleep(10)
        child.sendline('\r')
        # Enter Privileged EXEC Mode
        child.sendline('enable\r')
        child.expect_exact('R1#', timeout=5)
        print(child.before.decode('utf-8'))

Ping the router’s default gateway:

         R1#ping 192.168.1.1

         Type escape sequence to abort.

         R1#write memory ! Save the new configuration to flash memory
         Building configuration...
         [OK]
         R1#

Now look at the new and current configuration of the router

         R1#show running-config
         Building configuration...

         Current configuration :
         ...
         end

         #R1

Compare to the startup configuration settings in the NVRAM:

         #R1show startup-config
         Using 1985 out of 155640 bytes
         ...
         end

         R1#

Now copy the current settings to the NVRAM. At the "Destination filename" prompt, press **[Enter]** or input "startup-config":

         R1#copy running-config startup-config
         Destination filename [startup-config]?
         Building configuration...
         [OK]
         R1#
